## BCI (Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical Image Generation)
##### Introduced by Liu et al. in BCI: Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical Image Generation through Pyramid Pix2pix
#####    The evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is essential to formulate a precise treatment for breast cancer. The routine evaluation of HER2 is conducted with immunohistochemical techniques (IHC), which is very expensive. Therefore, we propose a breast cancer immunohistochemical (BCI) benchmark attempting to synthesize IHC data directly with the paired hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained images. The dataset contains *4870 registered image pairs*, covering a variety of HER2 expression levels (0, 1+, 2+, 3+).

#### The BCI dataset is extensive, and working with such a large dataset can be challenging, especially during the initial stages of a project. To address this, I have created a Python script to *reduce the dataset size* while maintaining a balanced subset for quick experiments and prototyping.

#### This smaller version of the dataset will save time and resources, making it more convenient for researchers and developers. ðŸ˜Š
